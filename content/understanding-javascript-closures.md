# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework for building web apps. It enables you to build both static websites and dynamic server-side rendered apps.

## Features

- **File-based routing**: No need to configure route handlers; Next.js uses files in the `pages` directory.
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: Pages can be rendered on the server for better performance.
- **Static site generation (SSG)**: Next.js enables you to pre-render pages at build time, offering fast load times.

## Getting Started

To create a Next.js app, first install `create-next-app` and then create a project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
